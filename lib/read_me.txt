king can move one square either direction
queen can move in any direction but a straight line
rook can move in straight line left right up or down
bishop can move diagonal
knight can move in L-shape 2-x 1-y vice versa
pawn can move straight 1 square or can move diagonal to take a piece

##the rules##
a piece has a condition in which they can kill another piece
example a queen can move in any direction in a line , but if there is a piece in the way to that location its not a legal move
a king can move 1 square to any direction again if there is a piece in the way it cant move,
this logic is applied to all except for the knight , which moves in an l shape, (in this case it does apply to some degree because
it cant move to that square if it is a friendly unit)
